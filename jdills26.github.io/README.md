# Tanzania-water-table

Am using data sets provided by drivendata.org to predict if water pumps will be functional, need repair, or non-functional.

Data-explore shows my preliminary analysis of the data and some nice countplots in seaborn

Clean-up shows how I removed features and created new ones for operation year, season, and rural/urban setting

Model-and-predict-data shows my first tries with logistic regression and random forest classifier. Using rfc currently have a score of 0.7055 which ranks me at 270 out of ~1500 competitors.
